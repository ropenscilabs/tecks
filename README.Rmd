[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sckott/tecks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sckott/tecks)

Wrapper for Python's [bibtexparser](https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io) [src](https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser)

the `bibtex` pkg may or may not be getting attention moving forward - maybe this will help in the meantime ...

**BEWARE: VERY ALPHA**

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("sckott/tecks")
```

```{r}
library("tecks")
```

## read bibtex file

```{r}
z <- system.file("extdata/bib-many.bib", package = "tecks")
out <- teck_read(path = z)
out
names(out)
```

`entries` is probably the thing you want

```{r}
out$entries
```
